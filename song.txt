As the drum roll started on that day
Heard a hundred miles away
A million shells were fired
And the green fields turned to grey
The bombardment lasted all day long
Yet the forts were standing strong
Heavily defended
Now the trap's been sprung and the battle has begun
Descend into darkness
303 days below the sun
Fields of Verdun, and the battle has begun
Nowhere to run, father and son
Fall one by one under the gun
Thy will be done (thy will be done), and the judgement has begun
Nowhere to run, father and son
Fall one by one, fields of Verdun
